# React Template Repository

This is a template repository for a full-stack, dockerized application using React, React-Router, Webpack, Express, and SASS. It includes:

- Webpack production optimizations
- Webpack proxying for backend
- Multi-stage docker build for minimal image
- SASS & loaders for styling
- Express for SPA backend
- React-router for routes
- Lazy-loading for optimization
- BundleAnalyzerPlugin for bundle management
- URL Loader for Images/Assets
- Jest for testing
- Github Actions for CI
- ESLint for Linting

## Future Changes

I'm going to add Github actions for CI/CD and Jest for testing.
